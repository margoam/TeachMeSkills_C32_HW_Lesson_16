# TeachMeSkills_C32_HW_Lesson_16
### Here is implemented the following:
- Create a collection of passport numbers (format: String).
- Create a collection of students in our group.
- Each collection should not contain duplicate elements.
- Create a key-value collection where the key is a passport number from the first collection, and the value is an object of the Student class from the second collection.
- Iterate over the key-value collection using a for-each loop and print the elements of the collection to the screen.
